# Learning 2D Game Development in Godot

A repository of projects I made while learning how to develop games in Godot, following a course on [Gamedev.tv](https://www.gamedev.tv/). The project files and executables of three games are included.

Special thanks to [Kenney](https://kenney.nl/) for some of the assets used.

## Games

- **First Project**: Not a game, just a small project to explore the Godot software.
- **Speedy Saucer**: Navigate a flying saucer through a challenging course! Very basic game, no UI, no way to win or finish, but the tricky controls add some depth.

  *Controls: WASD or arrow keys to move.*
- **Alien Attack**: A classic side-scrolling shoot 'em up, move a space ship around and shoot the incoming enemies. You have three lives, so be careful and don't let them get too close!

  *Controls: WASD to move, space bar to shoot lasers.*
- **Martian Mike**: Play as the titular Mike, and run and jump your way through this platformer. Use jump pads to reach new heights, and watch out for spiky traps! Each of the three levels has a 20 second timer and a unique theme.

  *Controls: AD or left-right arrow keys to move, space bar to jump, esc to quit, R to restart level.*
